# BiologicalMotion
Processing code to turn csv coordinates into a biological motion video!
Biological motion allows animals to process movement with very little cues.
For example:
[Biological Motion Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG_U5m4FShs)
In this video you can only see white dots on the joints of the individuals, but your brain is able to interpret these individual dots as motion!
We were interested to see if Jumping Spiders could do the same thing.
This code takes in a series of CSV files one for each joint that is tracked and returns a quicktime movie.

We tracked our movements using ImageJ>mtrackJ
